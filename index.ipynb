    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice doing a power-analysis during experimental design. As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under-sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the impact of sample size and effect size on power \n",
    "- Perform power calculation using SciPy and Python \n",
    "- Demonstrate the combined effect of sample size and effect size on statistical power using simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",

    "A researcher wants to study how daily protein supplementation in the elderly population will affect baseline liver fat. The study budget will allow enrollment of 24 patients. Half will be randomized to a placebo group and half to the protein supplement treatment group and the trial will be carried out over one month.

    "In this lesson, you gained further practice with \"statistical power\" and how it can be used to analyze experimental design. You ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power (for a given alpha and effect size). Running simulations like this, as well as further investigations regarding required sample sizes for higher power thresholds or smaller effect sizes is critical in designing meaningful experiments where one can be confident in the subsequent conclusions drawn."
